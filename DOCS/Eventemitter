on and emit method from events module

on method -> listens to events
emit method -> emits events which need to be responded back

const EventEmitter = require('events')
const customeEmitter = new EventEmitter()
customeEmitter.on('response' , (name, id ) => {
    console.log("data received")
    console.log(`${name} ${id}`)
})
